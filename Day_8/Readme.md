# Topics:
------------------

	-Logistic Regression
	-Classification
	
# Classification: 
----------------
    A machine learning task that deals with identifying the class to which an instance belongs.

# Evaluation metric: 
  - Accuracy,
  - Confusion matrix


# Types of classification:
------------------------
	-Binary classification:
		-classification problem has only two possible outcomes, then
		it is called as Binary classification.
		
		-eg: YES/NO, MALE/FEMALE, SPAM/NOTSPAM
	
	-Multi-class classification:
		-classification problem has more than two outcomes, then 
		it is called as Multi-class classification.
		
			-eg: classification of disorders, classification of size of T-shirt,
			classification of types of crops, classification of music
			
# Learners:
------------
	-Lazy learner: 
		-stores training dataset and wait until test dataset is provided.
		-eg: K-NN algorithm
	
	-Eager Learner:
		-develop classification model based on training dataset before 
		receiving the test dataset
		-Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, ANN

# Classification Techniques:
--------------------------
	-Base classifier
		-Decision Tree
		-Rule base Method
		-Nearest Neighbour
		-Naive Bayes
		-Support Vector Machine (SVM)
		-Neural Network
		
	Ensemble classifier:
		-Boosting
		-Bagging
		-Random Forest
