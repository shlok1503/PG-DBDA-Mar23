# Homework: 
## Problem statement : Pumpkin Pricing
    Load up required libraries and datasets. Convert the data to a data frame containing a subset of the data:
    
    1. Only get pumpkins priced by the bushel
    2. Convert the date to a month
    3. Calculate the price to be an average of high and low prices
    4. Convert the price to reflect the pricing by bushel quantity

    Could you implement the Polynomial regression to identify the best time to buy Pumpkins? 

    Use dataset D6data1.csv
