# Topics:
------------------
	-Classification Algorithm
	-Naive Bayes
	-Decision Tree
	
# Probability Language:
-----------------------
Event: is a result that an outcome may occur

Probability: is a value between 1 and 0 that an event will occur

certain: means an event will occur and has a probability of 1

uncertain: means an event won't occur and has a probability of 0

Even chance: means there is a 50:50 chance of the event occuring


# Conditional Probability:
-------------------------
P(A/B) : Probability of A given B

P(AnB) : Probability of A and b intersection

P(B) : Probability of B
